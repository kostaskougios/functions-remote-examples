# - First we need to publish the exported LsFunctions locally
# - Then we can compile the receiver & caller. The sbt config invokes the functions-remote-sbt-plugin to
#   generate the code (http4s routes for the server and http4s client helpers for the client)
# - The code is generated when we do an `sbt compile` for a module.
# Note: the sbt plugin will re-generate the code only after a "clean"
