# - First we need to publish the exported KafkaFunctions locally.
# - Then we can compile the receiver & caller. The sbt config invokes the functions-remote-sbt-plugin to
#   generate the code (serializers, factories etc)
# Note: the sbt plugin will re-generate the code only after a "clean".
#
# This will run the producer and consumer at the end, which expect kafka on port 9092 to be running.
