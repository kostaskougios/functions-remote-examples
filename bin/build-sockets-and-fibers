# - First we need to publish the exported trait's artifact locally. The published jar will be read by the code generator in order to
#   generate the caller / receiver / serialization / transport classes. The code generator resolves the artifact locally or from
#   a maven repository using Coursier.
# - After generating the code (via compiling), we are ready to run the server and client
# - The code is generated when we do an `sbt compile` for a module.
# Note: the sbt plugin will re-generate the code only after a "clean"
