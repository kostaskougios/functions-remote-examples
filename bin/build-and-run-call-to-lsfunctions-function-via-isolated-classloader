# - First we need to publish the exported trait's artifact locally. The published jar will be read by the code generator in order to
#   generate the caller / receiver / serialization / transport classes. The code generator resolves the artifact locally or from
#   a maven repository using Coursier.
# - Then we need to publish ls-receiver locally because the jars are used by the isolated classloader to load and run the implementation.
#   (we do a compile first because it seems sbt doesn't see the generated classes if we just do a publishLocal)
# - Finally we run the caller which calls the functions. Internally the isolated class loader is used to load the function's impl.
# Note: the sbt plugin will re-generate the code only after a "clean"
